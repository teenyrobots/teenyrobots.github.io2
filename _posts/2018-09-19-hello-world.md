After undergrad, in 2010, I was desperate to go into information science. I researched programs in my area, priced them, out, came up with various hair-brained schemes to [pay for it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-income_ratio). Part of this desperation came from graduating into a recession with a comics degree (ooops), but part of it was from feeling like I'd never keep anything straight now that I was out of school.



[Catalogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalog) have always been an object of fascination for me. Library card catalogs, entomological and plant catalogs, even the Sears catalog that came in the paper on Sundays. I love taxonomies, I love understanding how groups of things interconnect and interdepend, how they're simliar and how they're special. It's what makes me both good at identifying trees and pumping out design comps.

Despite this obsession with information and its categorizations, I've never been great at recall; I don't know [which Stephen King books I've read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1398297-joycer?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search%5Bquery%5D=stephen+king), I always doubt my internal [edible plants](https://www.google.com/search?q=chicken+of+the+woods&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiigK2AjcjdAhW7HjQIHQcfC9YQ_AUIDigB&biw=1680&bih=948) inventory, and I can never remember the title of my [favorite book on HTML5](https://books.google.com/books/about/HTML5.html?id=uuGbAgAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description). I have always needed clues. I rely heavily on information systems, and I'm always trying to optimize them, to better uplift my brain's natural recall (or lack there of).

For a long time, my blog was a sketchbook, a place to catalog one kind of information. This was [okay for a long time](http://teenyrobots.tumblr.com), but it never felt like a great place to explore ideas from multiple angles. Using lots of different places and tools on the internet, I tried to build the set of resources I was looking for, but it never quite emerged. My catalogs have lived in paper sketchbooks and college ruled spiral-bounds, unreferencable, unsearchable, uncategorized.

After several years away from blogging, I find myself looking for that robust catalog again. So many platforms have grown to replace the blogs of [the noughties](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/noughties), but the ways they control our speech—from format control, to limiting distribution, to outright censorship—have become completely intolerable. None of them are great places to store ideas anymore.

My need to file and save new information has only grown. Almost ten years after feverishly researching library science programs, I now [work full time with media companies exploring what it means to tell stories in digital spaces](http://teenyrobots.net/work.html). [I teach young artists the basic webstack](https://www.cca.edu/academics/faculty/jrice2) so they can make their own art on the web (I also make them blog about it). I speak on creative collaboration and making basic design more accessible to other disciplines. I learn new things every day, and from so many sources, it sometimes seems like more dissipates than sticks.

Catalogs help us find things. We can store research, document new ideas, and create collections that inspire us. I'm looking forward to trying a new way to organize all the ideas I want to find again. I'm doing it in public because I think a lot of this work is worth sharing: I want to share my teeny catalog, this little log of professional practice over time. There are other places to store this kind of stuff, where one might accrue thumbs and hearts and other sorts of internet points, but I'm tired of not owning and controlling my content, so I'm going to do it right here for now.

To start, I'd like to share a few other catalogs that have inspired me to start researching, writing, and bookmarking in public again:

+ [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/), an inventory of cross-disciplinary interestingness
+ [Austin Kleon's blog](https://austinkleon.com/), a professional practices log (his newsletter is also pretty off the chain)
+ [Ann Friedman's newsletter](https://www.annfriedman.com/weekly/), a collection of news worth sharing

*tldr*: dear mom, I decided to become a librarian after all
