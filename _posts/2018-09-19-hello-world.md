okay so writing blogs and stuff.

- After undergrad, in 2010, I was desperate to go into information science. Part of this was graduating into a recession with a comics degree, but part of it was feeling like i'd never be able to keep all the things i knew straight
- i have a hunger for knowledge
- My memory isn't great for recall, I need storage systems
- For a long time my blog was just a sketchbook. This was a good way to log drawing, but it never felt like a good place to write.
- i read all the time and struggle with organizing information from different sources
- i'm also tired of letting other platforms control my speech—from format control to limited distribution, to outright censoring
- a weblog is a place to develop those information systems, a place where i can find things
- tracking research, documenting new ideas, collecting things i like, dissecting stories, figuring out what digital art has in common with edible plants. cataloguing
- some catalogues that inspire me: austin kleon's, ann friedman's newsletter, the immerse newsletter
- card catalogue from hell
- tldr: dear mom, i decided to become a librarian after all

After undergrad, in 2010, I was desperate to go into information science. I researched programs in my area, priced them, out, tried to figure out if I could pay for it. Part of this desperation came from graduating into a recession with a comics degree (ooops), but part of it was feeling like I'd never keep anything straight now that I was out of school.

I have a hunger for knowledge. My favorite website is Wikipedia, and my favorite place is the used book store. Despite this constrant quest for new information, I've never had a great memory (SOME BETTER WAY TO PUT THIS). I don't know which Stephen King books I've read, and I can't remember the title of my favorite book on HTML5. I have always needed clues. I have always relied heavily on information systems, and I'm always trying to optimize them, to better support my brain's natural recall (or lack there of).

For a long time, my blog was just a sketchbook, a place to store one kind of information. This was fun before social media became everyone's sketchbook, but it never felt like a great place to write. Once social media became more robust, it just seemed like a poor mirror of several other disparate streams. It wasn't quite the catalogue I was trying to create.

After several years away from blogs, of using lots of other places to store my clues and research, I'm starting to look for that catalogue again. So many platforms have grown to replace the blogs of pre-2010, but I'm getting tired of the ways they control our speech—from format control, to limiting distribution of content, to outright censorship. None of them are great places to store ideas anymore.

Catalogues help us find things. We can store research, document new ideas, and create collections that inspire us. I'm looking forward to trying a new way to organize all this information I think is valuable. I'm doing it in public because I think there's a lot worth sharing. Processes that can help other people that create art on the internet, resources we can use, things I've learned after 8+ years of working for myself. There are other places to store this kind of stuff, where I can accrue claps and mentions and other sorts of internet points, but I'm tired of not owning my content, so I'm going to do it here.

To start, I'd like to share a few other catalogues that have inspired me to start researching, writing, and bookmarking in public again:
- Austin Kleon's blog, a professional practices log
- Ann Friedman's newsletter, a collection of news worth sharing
- The Immerse newsletter, a catalogue of goings on in the world of interactive media
