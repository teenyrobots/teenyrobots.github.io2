_Denver Independent Comics & Art Expo_


In two weeks I’ll be packing my bags for the Denver Independent Comics & Art Expo on April 13th and 14th.  [DiNK Denver](https://dinkdenver.com/) “is a celebration of artists, writers, creators, zine makers, graffiti artists, tattoo arts and publishers from around the world.”  There will be over 250 exhibitors, panel discussion, craft sessions, and lots of other great stuff. Indie Press Expos are a really unique opportunity to learn new stuff and make new friends, and I can't wait for this one.

This will be my first time at DiNK, finally marrying my love for comics with my love for the Rocky Mountains. I’ll be representing the [CCA MFA in Comics](https://www.cca.edu/humanities-sciences/mfa-comics/), where I teach [Digital Comics](https://comics.cca.edu/) in their low-residency summer program. The CCA Comics community is such a treasure, and I love being a part of it. Come by and ask me anything about our program!

Because I’m so excited about DiNK, I’m going to be debuting a new minicomic called Diary of a Young Hag. It combines my Inktober2018 illustrations of witch in her 30s with a personal essay about my experience turning 30.

If you won’t be making it to Colorado in April, never fear—in the next couple weeks I’m also setting up an all-new-and-improved online store with all my latest work. Also launching with the store are: a print mini of Debt Trap, stickers for W.l.T.C.H.es, a luxurious paper version of Hotel California, and more to come!
