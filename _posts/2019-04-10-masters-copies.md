Copying the masters! It's what we Arr-teests are supposed to do, especially as students. I really failed to appreciate this exercise literally at all for the duration of my formal education, despite going to school down the street from a major art museum.

This year I'm trying to practice *everything* more, especially drawing. I'm trying to be a student again. My goal for this year was to do 50 copies of basically any piece of art I find compelling, and try to learn something from it. I've done 12 so far. Maybe I'll start tracking them as a list, that could be interesting. I try not to work on them for more than 30 or 40 minutes total. This helps me stay loose and not get too obsessed with perfection.

This week I copied Witches' Sabbath 	(1797-1798) by Francisco Goya:

And the original:

I'm really working on depicting shapes using light instead of heavy lines and environmental. Looking at both paintings side-by-side I mostly see mistakes, but when I look at just my copy I see the areas where I'm improving, or doing something new.

Goya painted this during the later part of the Spanish Inquisition. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witches'_Sabbath_(Goya,_1798)), Goya's paintings of witches covens were an act of protest against the way the Spanish Inquisition used a culture of fear to control people. "Goya's depictions of such scenes mocked what he saw as medieval fears exploited by the established order for political and capital gain." Illustration is a powerful tool for protest, and those who hold that pen have the responsibility to wield it well.
