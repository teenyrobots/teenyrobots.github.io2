Copying the masters! It's what we Arr-teests are supposed to do, especially as students. I really failed to appreciate this exercise literally at all for the duration of my formal education, despite going to school down the street from a major art museum.

This year I'm trying to practice *everything* more, especially drawing. I'm trying to be a student again. My goal for this year was to do 50 copies of basically any piece of art I find compelling, and try to learn something from it. I've done 12 so far. Maybe I'll start tracking them as a list, that could be interesting. I try not to work on them for more than 30 or 40 minutes total. This helps me stay loose and not get too obsessed with perfection.

This week I copied Witches' Sabbath 	(1797-1798) by Francisco Goya:

And the original:

I'm really working on depicting shapes using light instead of heavy lines and environmental. Looking at both paintings side-by-side I mostly see mistakes, but when I look at just my copy I see the areas where I'm improving, or doing something new.

Goya painted this during the later part of the Spanish Inquisition. According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witches'_Sabbath_(Goya,_1798)), Goya's paintings of witches covens were an act of protest against the way the Spanish Inquisition used a culture of fear to control people. "Goya's depictions of such scenes mocked what he saw as medieval fears exploited by the established order for political and capital gain." Illustration is a powerful tool for protest, and those who hold that pen have the responsibility to wield it well.

Here are a few more masters' copies I've worked on this year:

I spent more than 30 minutes on some of these, but I've been trying hard to keep the exercise at around half an hour. Even when I didn't feel like I got very far, or like my work would never be as good as this, I've learned a *lot* from each copy. If you're trying to add new skills to your library I highly recommend the exercise! Don't be too hard on yourself about it, the point is to learn.
