[Catalogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalog){:target="_blank"} have always been an object of fascination for me. In 1993 I was astonished to learn that the card catalog at the elementary school library, an unassuming brick of drawers dense with arcanely marked index cards, held reference to every! single! book! Entomological catalogs, historical catalogs, and even the department store catalogs that came in the paper on Sundays were equally mesmerizing.

Taxonomy is the branch of science concerned with classification: we create systems to understand how groups of things interconnect and interdepend, how they're simliar and how they're special, and what they can accomplish as a whole. My love of taxonomies, catalogs, and other organization systems is what makes me good at identifying trees and at pumping out design comps. It wasn't until after college that I learned catalogs comprised an entire field of study; in another life, I would have studied information science rather than illustration.

Despite this obsession with information and its categorizations, I've never been great at recall; I don't know [which Stephen King books I've read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1398297-joycer?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search%5Bquery%5D=stephen+king){:target="_blank"}, I always doubt my internal [edible plants](https://www.google.com/search?q=chicken+of+the+woods&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiigK2AjcjdAhW7HjQIHQcfC9YQ_AUIDigB&biw=1680&bih=948){:target="_blank"} inventory, and I can never remember the title of my [favorite book on HTML5](https://books.google.com/books/about/HTML5.html?id=uuGbAgAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description){:target="_blank"}. I have always needed clues, catalogs, or information systems to store things I'd like to remember. The more we use a system, the more useful it is, so as we invest in them, they invest in us.

For a long time, my blog was a sketchbook, a place to catalog one kind of information. [This was okay](http://teenyrobots.tumblr.com){:target="_blank"}, but it never felt like a great place to explore ideas from multiple angles. Sketching represents only the very tip of the creative iceberg—to make great art, we must observe the world outside the studio: that which forms in nature, that which others have created, and that which still need solving. I've found great inspiration in other creative catalogs, like [Austin Kleon's studio practice log](https://austinkleon.com/){:target="_blank"}, or [Brain Pickings cross-disciplinary design inventory](https://www.brainpickings.org/){:target="_blank"}. Catalogs like these are living organisms we can learn from, and with, over time.

Over the years, I have used lots of different platforms and digital gadgetry to build catalogs I could grow with, but they have always fallen short. There's never enough cross-pollination between my [Goodreads library](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1398297-joycer){:target="_blank"} and my [GitHub repos](https://github.com/teenyrobots){:target="_blank"}. My best catalogs have lived in paper sketchbooks and college ruled spiral-bounds, unreferencable, unsearchable, uncategorized. A professional practices log interred unorganized in densely packed boxes, the opposite of the library.

When blogs began, they were the *only* form of simple digital publication available, and so they became the new, experimental, digital zines of [the noughties](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/noughties){:target="_blank"}. Since then countless new platforms have emerged to facilitate our cataloging and our communicating. In some ways, these are exciting services—everyone is there, clapping and hearting and thumbs-upping. But the ways these platforms control our speech—from its format, to limiting distribution, to outright censorship—have become intolerable. None of them are great places to store ideas anymore.

Catalogs help us store research, document new ideas, and create collections that inspire us. What's more, they help us find things and help us connect them. The relationships between the entries, the taxonomy, is part of its inherent value. This is a place where I'll be storing my own personal taxonomy of research on art and design in a digital age—a place to talk about the rest of the iceberg, how observation informs practice. I hope that by building my teeny catalog in public, you'll be able to add some new entries to yours.
