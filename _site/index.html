              The making of Debt
            </a>
          </h3>
          <div>
            <p>Last week my most recent nonfiction comic was published on the Nib (read <a href="https://thenib.com/americans-are-drowning-in-debt">Americans Are Drowning in Debt</a> here if you haven’t gotten a chance yet). I thought I would write a little about my process making a non-fiction comics.</p>

<h2 id="ideate">Ideate</h2>
<p><img src="/../assets/postImages/022619-1-debtfriends.png" alt="Debt friends" />
My friends and I are in <em>a lot</em> debt. I’m an X-er (and I’ve got the haircut to prove it), so most of our debt is not “good” debt like a mortgage. We joke about it sometimes, but honestly debt is a very shameful topic in the US so we mostly pretend our lives are really carefree and that we can afford to buy expensive green fruit that is often already rotten when you open it.</p>

<p>I was really interested in:</p>

<ol>
  <li>learning more about debt in the United States and how we got here</li>
  <li>opening a public dialogue about debt so we can all feel a little less ashamed about it</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="-collaborate"><a name="ab"></a> Collaborate</h2>
<p><img src="/../assets/postImages/022619-2-collaborate.png" alt="Collaboratively mobbing" />
I don’t actually write non-fiction, so all I really had were suspicions about American debt. Luckily I happen to know a writer<a href="#a">*</a> and activist who used to be a bankruptcy lawyer. I asked <a href="https://kevmo.io/">Kevin Moore</a> if he’d be interested in doing a comic together about debt based on his “standard American Debt Rant” and he said yes.</p>

<p>This was Kevin’s first comic, so we worked together on an outline for a 30 panel comic, which translates to about 7-8 pages of material (and is a fairly standard size for feature-length comics journalism). We decided to cover US debt history, give an overview of the most common kinds of debt, and talk about little about debt futurism.</p>

<h2 id="script">Script</h2>
<p><img src="/../assets/postImages/022619-3-scripting.png" alt="Scripting" />
We pitched this story <a href="https://thenib.com/">to my favorite comics outlet</a> and they accepted it! Then I sat back while Kevin did the reporting. Although we had seen the effects of the debt industry first hand, the history was almost worse than I was expecting.</p>

<p>It was actually really hard to keep the script short and to the point because there have been so many specific injustices at play here for generations. We worked with seasoned comics journalism editor Andy Warner, and he and Kevin took the script through a few drafts.  Once the script was finalized, it was turned over to me for drawing.</p>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p><img src="/../assets/postImages/022619-4-brainstorm.jpg" alt="Ideas" />
When I get a finalized script, whether I’ve worked on it at all or not, the first thing I do is sit down and try to find the over-arching visual narrative. I usually do this by doodling on a clean sketchbook page as I read the script over several times. When the page is full, I look for the common threads, and find the ideas that hit me hardest. In this case, what really struck me was how <em>pervasive</em> debt was, and how it sticks to people and things and stops them from moving forward. That’s how I came up with Debt Slime.</p>

<p>Then I go through and cut together a very, very loose version of the comic that shows the basic composition of the page and each panel. I submitted this to my editor, and he gave me some feedback and the go ahead to final art.</p>

<h2 id="drawing">Drawing</h2>

  <source src="/../assets/postImages/022619-5-debt.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

<p>Then I drew for nine million years.  After my concepts are approved, there are three basic stages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Penciling</li>
  <li>Inking</li>
  <li>Coloring</li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately each panel takes about an hour, give or take. It’s really easy to get tunnel vision here, so I got feedback from Kevin and Andy after each stage. That feedback helps push me to my best compositions and visual metaphors. I especially struggled with the color palette on this one, but I’m really proud of how it came out!</p>

<h2 id="profit">Profit!!</h2>
<p><img src="/../assets/postImages/022619-6-profit.png" alt="Wreck that debt" />
Kevin and I got some green fruits to celebrate, and all over they were only about 30% rotten. I’m still in a lot of debt, but I do feel slightly less bad about it now.</p>

<p>As a child I was fascinated by the card catalog at the library. This unassuming brick of drawers, dense with arcanely marked cards, held reference to every! single! book! I’ve never been great at recall—I didn’t, for example, know how many or which books I’d already read, or even how to conceive of the data set. The card catalog introduced me to my first information system, a hint that maybe a photographic memory wasn’t so important, if you knew where to look. Catalogs can be vehicles to make sense of the world around us.</p>

<p>Of course it’s not enough just to catalog. Taxonomy is the branch of science concerned with classification: good systems reflect how groups of things interconnect and interdepend, how they’re simliar and how they’re special, and how they work as a whole. These relationships are how we advance our understanding of the world, and make sense of the way it falls around us.</p>

<p>Often it seems my work as an artist is really to be an archivist, a cataloger. It’s those interconnections that advance my work, and my primary professional task is to find the right one for each problem. How does this relate to the things around it? How is that meaningful? Over the years, I have used lots of different platforms and digital gadgetry to build catalogs, but they have always fallen short. There’s never enough cross-pollination between my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1398297-joycer" target="_blank">Goodreads library</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/teenyrobots" target="_blank">GitHub repos</a>. My best catalogs have lived in paper sketchbooks and college ruled spiral-bounds: unreferencable, unsearchable, uncategorized. A professional practices log interred in densely packed boxes, the opposite of a card catalog.</p>

<p>So, I’ve been on the prowl for a professional practices log that works. I’ve found great inspiration in other creative catalogs, like <a href="https://austinkleon.com/" target="_blank">Austin Kleon’s studio practice log</a>, or <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/" target="_blank">Brain Pickings cross-disciplinary design inventory</a>. Catalogs like these are living organisms we can learn from, and with, over time. For a long time, my own blog was a sketchbook, a place to catalog one kind of information. <a href="http://teenyrobots.tumblr.com" target="_blank">This was okay</a>, but it never felt like a great place to explore ideas from multiple angles. Actually drawing represents only the very tip of the creative iceberg—to make great art, we must observe the world outside the studio. We have to study.</p>

<p>The web is a natural place to document creative practices. When blogs began, they were the only form of simple digital publication available, and so they became the new, experimental, digital zines of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/noughties" target="_blank">the noughties</a>. From the beginning blogs were interconnected—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Loomis" target="_blank">Andrew Loomis</a> and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA</a> are equally referencable. The web connects my catalog to yours and millions of others all over the world, a meeting of minds inconceivable just 100 years ago.</p>

<p>Since then countless new platforms have emerged to facilitate our cataloging and our communicating. In some ways, this is exciting—the gang’s all here, clapping and hearting and thumbs-upping. But the ways these platforms control our speech—format, distribution, outright censorship—have become intolerable. None of them are great places to store ideas anymore.</p>

<p>This is the place where I’ll be storing my own personal catalog of research on art and design in a digital age—a place to talk about the rest of the iceberg, how observation informs practice. I hope that by building my teeny catalog in public, you’ll be able to add some new entries to yours.</p>

<p>After undergrad, in 2010, I was desperate to go into information science. I researched programs in my area, priced them, out, came up with various hare-brained schemes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-income_ratio" target="_blank">pay for it</a>. Part of this desperation came from graduating into a recession with a comics degree (ooops), but part of it was from feeling like I’d never keep anything straight now that I was out of school.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalog" target="_blank">Catalogs</a> have always been an object of fascination for me. Library card catalogs, entomological and plant catalogs, even the Sears catalog that came in the paper on Sundays. I love taxonomies, I love understanding how groups of things interconnect and interdepend, how they’re simliar and how they’re special. It’s what makes me both good at identifying trees and pumping out design comps.</p>

<p>Despite this obsession with information and its categorizations, I’ve never been great at recall; I don’t know <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1398297-joycer?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;search%5Bquery%5D=stephen+king" target="_blank">which Stephen King books I’ve read</a>, I always doubt my internal <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=chicken+of+the+woods&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiigK2AjcjdAhW7HjQIHQcfC9YQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=948" target="_blank">edible plants</a> inventory, and I can never remember the title of my <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/HTML5.html?id=uuGbAgAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description" target="_blank">favorite book on HTML5</a>. I have always needed clues. I rely heavily on information systems, and I’m always trying to optimize them, to better uplift my brain’s natural recall (or lack there of).</p>

<p>For a long time, my blog was a sketchbook, a place to catalog one kind of information. This was <a href="http://teenyrobots.tumblr.com" target="_blank">okay for a long time</a>, but it never felt like a great place to explore ideas from multiple angles. Using lots of different places and tools on the internet, I tried to build the set of resources I was looking for, but it never quite emerged. My catalogs have lived in paper sketchbooks and college ruled spiral-bounds, unreferencable, unsearchable, uncategorized.</p>

<p>After several years away from blogging, I find myself looking for that robust catalog again. So many platforms have grown to replace the blogs of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/noughties" target="_blank">the noughties</a>, but the ways they control our speech—from format control, to limiting distribution, to outright censorship—have become completely intolerable. None of them are great places to store ideas anymore.</p>

<p>My need to file and save new information has only grown. Almost ten years after feverishly researching library science programs, I now <a href="http://teenyrobots.net/work.html">work full time with media companies exploring what it means to tell stories in digital spaces</a>. I <a href="https://www.cca.edu/academics/faculty/jrice2" target="_blank">teach young artists the basic webstack</a> so they can make their own art on the web (I also make them blog about it). I speak on creative collaboration and making basic design more accessible to other disciplines. I learn new things every day, and from so many sources, it sometimes seems like more dissipates than sticks.</p>

<p>Catalogs help us find things. We can store research, document new ideas, and create collections that inspire us. I’m looking forward to trying a new way to organize all the ideas I want to find again. I’m doing it in public because I think a lot of this work is worth sharing: I want to share my teeny catalog, this little log of professional practice over time. There are other places to store this kind of stuff, where one might accrue thumbs and hearts and other sorts of internet points, but I’m tired of not owning and controlling my content, so I’m going to do it right here for now.</p>

<p>To start, I’d like to share a few other catalogs that have inspired me to start researching, writing, and bookmarking in public again:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/" target="_blank">Brain Pickings</a>, an inventory of cross-disciplinary interestingness</li>
  <li><a href="https://austinkleon.com/" target="_blank">Austin Kleon’s blog</a>, a professional practices log (his newsletter is also pretty off the chain)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.annfriedman.com/weekly/" target="_blank">Ann Friedman’s newsletter</a>, a collection of news worth sharing</li>
</ul>

<p><em>tldr</em>: dear mom, I decided to become a librarian after all</p>

            <p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code class="highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
