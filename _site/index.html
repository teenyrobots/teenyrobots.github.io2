<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalog" target="_blank">Catalogs</a> have always been an object of fascination for me. In 1993 I was astonished to learn that the card catalog at the elementary school library, an unassuming brick of drawers dense with arcanely marked index cards, held reference to every! single! book! Entomological catalogs, historical catalogs, even the explosively colorful, posed department store catalogs that came in the paper on Sundays, were equally mesmerizing. Hours of my childhood were spent flipping aimlessly through the thin, packed pages.</p>

<p>Taxonomy is the branch of science concerned with classification: we create systems to understand how groups of things interconnect and interdepend, how they’re simliar and how they’re special, and what they can accomplish as a whole. My love of taxonomies, catalogs, and other organization systems is what makes me good at identifying trees and at pumping out design comps. It wasn’t until after college that I learned catalogs comprised an entire field of study; in another life, I would have studied information science rather than illustration.</p>

<p>Despite this obsession with information and its categorizations, I’ve never been great at recall; I don’t know <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1398297-joycer?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;search%5Bquery%5D=stephen+king" target="_blank">which Stephen King books I’ve read</a>, I always doubt my internal <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=chicken+of+the+woods&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiigK2AjcjdAhW7HjQIHQcfC9YQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=948" target="_blank">edible plants</a> inventory, and I can never remember the title of my <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/HTML5.html?id=uuGbAgAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description" target="_blank">favorite book on HTML5</a>. I have always needed clues, catalogs, or information systems to store things I’d like to remember. Systems can always be optimized to better support the humans using them, and so I’m always searching for new ways to optimize my own catalogs.</p>

<p>For a long time, my blog was a sketchbook, a place to catalog one kind of information. This was <a href="http://teenyrobots.tumblr.com" target="_blank">okay for awhile</a>, but it never felt like a great place to explore ideas from multiple angles. Sketching represents only the very tip of the creative iceberg. There are no great ideas in a vaccuum. To make great art, we must observe the world outside the studio: that which forms in nature, that which others have created, and that which still need solving. I’ve found great inspiration in other creative catalogs, like <a href="https://austinkleon.com/" target="_blank">Austin Kleon’s studio practice log</a>, or <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/" target="_blank">Brain Pickings cross-disciplinary design inventory</a>. Catalogs like these are like living objects we can learn from, and with, over time.</p>

<p>Over the years, using lots of different platforms and digital gadgetry, I tried to build my own set of resources. It never quite materialized as the interconnected web I envisioned. There was never enough cross-pollination between my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1398297-joycer" target="_blank">Goodreads library</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/teenyrobots" target="_blank">GitHub repos</a>. My best catalogs have lived in paper sketchbooks and college ruled spiral-bounds, unreferencable, unsearchable, uncategorized.</p>

<p>My need to file and save new information has only grown. Ten years after starting my very first blog, I now <a href="http://teenyrobots.net/work.html">work full time with media companies exploring what it means to tell stories in digital spaces</a>. I <a href="https://www.cca.edu/academics/faculty/jrice2" target="_blank">teach young artists the basic webstack</a> so they can make their own art on the web (I also make them blog about it). I speak on creative collaboration and making basic design more accessible to other disciplines. I learn new things every day, and from so many sources, but it seems to dissipate, or else is interred in densely packed boxes of loose scrawl in a damp basement I rarely visit.</p>

<p>After several years away from blogging, I find myself looking for that robust catalog again. When blogs began, they were the <em>only</em> form of digital publication available, and so they became the new, experimental, digital zines of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/noughties" target="_blank">the noughties</a>. Since then countless new platforms have emerged to facilitate our cataloging and our communicating. In some ways, these are exciting services—everyone is there, clapping and hearting and thumbs-upping. But the ways these platforms control our speech—from its format, to limiting distribution, to outright censorship—have become intolerable. None of them are great places to store ideas anymore.</p>

<p>Catalogs help us store research, document new ideas, and create collections that inspire us. What’s more, they help us find things and help us connect them. The relationships between the entries, the taxonomy, is part of its inherent value. This is a place where I’ll be storing my own personal taxonomy of research on art and design in a digital age—a place to talk about the rest of the iceberg, how observation informs practice. I hope that by building my teeny catalog in public, you’ll be able to add some new entries to yours.</p>
